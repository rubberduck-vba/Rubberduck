Since the project's early days, JetBrains' Open-Source team has been supporting Rubberduck - and we deeply thank them for that. ReSharper has been not only a tool we couldn't do without; it's been an inspiration, the ultimate level of polished perfection to strive for in our own IDE add-in project. So just like you're missing out if you write VBA and you're not using Rubberduck, you're missing out if you write C# and aren't using ReSharper.
