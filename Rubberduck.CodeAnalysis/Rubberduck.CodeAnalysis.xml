            <why>
            'While...Wend' loops were made obsolete when 'Do While...Loop' statements were introduced.
            'While...Wend' loops cannot be exited early without a GoTo jump; 'Do...Loop' statements can be conditionally exited with 'Exit Do'.

            <reference name="Excel" />
            <why>
            Another good reason to avoid numeric suffixes: if the function is meant to be used as a UDF in a cell formula,
            the worksheet cell by the same name takes precedence and gets the reference, and the function is never invoked.

            'IsMissing' only returns True when an optional Variant parameter was not supplied as an argument.
            This inspection flags uses that attempt to use 'IsMissing' for other purposes, resulting in conditions that are always False.

            The CDecl calling convention is only implemented in VBA for Mac; if Rubberduck can see it (Rubberduck only runs on Windows),

            Debugging is easier if the procedure's initial state is preserved and accessible anywhere within its scope.
            Mutating the inputs destroys the initial state, and makes the intent ambiguous: if the calling code is meant

            <why>
            An early-bound, equivalent function likely exists in the object returned by the Application.WorksheetFunction property; 
            late-bound member calls will fail at run-time with error 438 if there is a typo (a typo fails to compile for an early-bound member call). 
            Late-bound worksheet functions will return a Variant/Error given invalid inputs; 
            the equivalent early-bound member calls raise a more VB-idiomatic runtime error given the same invalid inputs. 
            A Variant/Error value cannot be coerced into any other data type, be it for assignment or comparison. 
            Trying to compare or assign a Variant/Error to another data type will throw error 13 "type mismatch" at run-time. 
            Consider using the early-bound equivalent function instead.

            Private module variables should be declared using the 'Private' keyword. While 'Dim' is also legal, it should preferably be

            Modules without a custom @Folder annotation will be grouped under the default folder in the Code Explorer toolwindow.

            Omitting the 'Set' keyword will Let-coerce the right-hand side (RHS) of the assignment expression. If the RHS is an object variable,

            <why>
            Implicit array lower bound is 0 by default, and Option Base 1 makes it 1. While compelling in a 1-based environment like the Excel object model, 
            having an implicit lower bound of 1 for implicitly-sized user arrays does not change the fact that arrays are always better off with explicit boundaries.
            Because 0 is always the lower array bound in many other programming languages, this option may trip a reader/maintainer with a different background.

            <why>
            An uninitialized variable is being read, but since it's never assigned, the only value ever read would be the data type's default initial value. 
            Reading a variable that was never written to in any code path (especially if Option Explicit isn't specified), is likely to be a bug.
            </why>
            <remarks>
            This inspection may produce false positives when the variable is an array, or if it's passed by reference (ByRef) to a procedure that assigns it.
            </remarks>

            <why>
            The public interface of any class module can be implemented by any other class module; if the public interface 
            contains names with underscores, other classes cannot implement it - the code will not compile. Avoid underscores; prefer PascalCase names.

            </summary>
            <why>
            'On Error Resume Next' should be constrained to a limited number of instructions, otherwise it supresses error handling 
            for the rest of the procedure; 'On Error GoTo 0' reinstates error handling. 
            This inspection helps treating 'Resume Next' and 'GoTo 0' as a code block (similar to 'With...End With'), essentially.
